tox Test Command
================

Command for running tox tests with `setuptools`_.

This way the usual command for running tests will call tox:

    python setup.py test

To achieve this the project should be using setuptools, and contain a setup.py
file, where the test command will be overriden.

This is detailed in the usage section.

Features
--------

- Running test with tox in any project using setuptools
- Running a specific tox profile

Documentation
-------------

Documentation sources are included with the project, and used to generate the
documentation sites:

- The `latest docs`_ are always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch
- The `development docs`_ are generated from the latest code in the 'develop' branch

You can also create the documentation from the source files, kept in the 'docs'
folder, with the help of `Sphinx`_. For this use the makefile, or the make.bat
file, contained on that folder.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project has been tested in the following versions of the interpreter:

- Python 3.4
- Python 3.5
- Python 3.6
- Pypy 3

All other dependencies are indicated on the requirements.txt file.

These can be installed with:

    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

The project is offered as a `Pypi package`_, and using pip is the preferred way
to install it. For this use the following command;

    pip install bernardomg.tox-test-command

If needed, manual installation is possible:

    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

The application has been coded in Python, and is meant for projects using `setuptools`_.

It can be used to override the default test command with ease::

    from tox_test_command import ToxTestCommand

    setup(
        ...
        cmdclass={'test': ToxTestCommand},
        ...
    )

This way the usual command for running tests will call the new command:

    python setup.py test

It is possible to run a specific tox profile:

    python setup.py test -p [profile-name]

Testing
-------

The tests included with the project can be run with:

    python setup.py test

This will delegate the execution to tox.

It is possible to run just one of the test profiles, in this case the py36 profile:

    python setup.py test -p "py36"

Collaborate
-----------

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

Issues management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues are managed at the GitHub `project issues tracker`_, where any Github
user may report bugs or ask for new features.

Getting the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the `GitHub project page`_, where
the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest
release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
