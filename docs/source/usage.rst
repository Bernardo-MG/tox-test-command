=====
Usage
=====

The application is meant for projects using `setuptools`_.

It can be used to override the default test command with ease::

    from tox_test_command import ToxTestCommand

    setup(
        ...
        cmdclass={'test': ToxTestCommand},
        ...
    )

This way the usual command for running tests will call the new command:

```
$ python setup.py test
```

It is possible to run a specific tox profile:

```
$ python setup.py test -p [profile-name]
```

-------
Testing
-------

The tests included with the project can be run with:

.. code::

    $ python setup.py test

This will delegate the execution to tox.

It is possible to run just one of the test profiles, in this case the py36 profile:

.. code::

    $ python setup.py test -p "py36"
